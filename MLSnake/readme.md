## Libraries

The supporting code for the agent is found here - each file has different versions, with the highest number being the most recent (although it may not be the one actually used for the agent).

* Agent.py: Base operating code for the Q-learning agent, executes actions, updates the model, etc.
* Game.py: Code for the snake game itself, capable of being controled either by a human player or the agent.
* Memory.py: Creates, loads, and saves the arrays for the agent's experience replay memory, along with some other auxiliary files.
* Tester.py: Used for debugging.
